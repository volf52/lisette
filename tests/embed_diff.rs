//! Differential tests for Go-style struct and interface embedding. Each test
//! builds a small graph of embedded types, renders it to both Go and Lisette,
//! and checks that Lisette resolves member access and interface satisfaction
//! the same way Go does. Lisette may reject what Go accepts as promotion is
//! yet to be built, but Lisette must never accept what Go rejects.
